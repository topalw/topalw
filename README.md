- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexandros
- 👀 I’m interested in how information coded in the DNA shapes the amazing complexity of life on earth.
- 🌱 I’m currently identifying recombination and mutation in the DNA of barn owls🦉.
- 💞️ I enjoy working on genetics from an evolutionary perspective. I also enjoy games 🎮, cooking time and beer(s) 🍺.
