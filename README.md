- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexandros
- 👀 I’m interested in how information coded in the DNA interacts with the environment to shape this amazing complexity of life on earth.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to find recombination and mutation in the DNA of barn owls.
- 💞️ I’m looking to work on GWAS in a wild population, to attempt to find the genetic basis of traits.
